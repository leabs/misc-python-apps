# Misc Python Apps

Some random apps in Python that can be run with a terminal. These are just for fun and to learn Python. These are in no way meant to be used for anything serious, and many have _zero error checking or validation_. Maybe that is something I can add in the future.

## Running the apps

To run the apps, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Download, clone, or fork the repository.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
- Change directories into the chosen app.
- Run the app using the command `python3 main.py` inside the chosen app directory.
- Some apps may require you to install additional Python modules. Use the requirements.txt file to install the modules by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the app directory. Apps with requirements.txt files are marked with an asterisk (\*) in the list below.

## Apps

- **CSV to JSON Converter** - Converts a CSV file to a JSON file. This uses a csv file called `data.csv` within the `csv-to-json` directory. Want to convert your own? Replace the `data.csv` file with your own and run the app with `python3 main.py` in the directory.
- **Password Generator** - Generates a random password with letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation.
- **Retirement Calculator** - Calculates how much you should have at your selected age of retirement with compounding interest. This also lets you calculate NYSLRS Tier 6 retirement benefits because that's what my wife has, lol.
- **Scrape All Copy**(\*) - Scrapes all the text from a website and saves it to a text file. Has requirements.txt file for installing the required modules.
