# misc-python-apps

Some random apps in python that can be run with a terminal. These are just for fun and to learn python.

## Executing the apps

To run the apps, you need to have python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Download, clone, or fork the repository.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
- Run the app using the command `python3 <app_name>.py`

## Apps

- **Retirement Calculator** - Calculates how much you should have at your selected age of retirement with compounding interest. This also lets you calculate NYSLRS Tier 6 retirement benefits because that's what my wife has, lol.
