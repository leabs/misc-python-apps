# misc-python-apps

Some random apps in python that can be run with a terminal. These are just for fun and to learn python.

## Executing the apps

To run the apps, you need to have python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Download, clone, or fork the repository.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
- Change directories into the chosen app.
- Run the app using the command `python3 main.py`
- Some apps may require you to install additional python modules. Use the requirements.txt file to install the modules by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Apps

- **Retirement Calculator** - Calculates how much you should have at your selected age of retirement with compounding interest. This also lets you calculate NYSLRS Tier 6 retirement benefits because that's what my wife has, lol.
- **Password Generator** - Generates a random password with letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation.
- **Scrape All Copy** - Scrapes all the text from a website and saves it to a text file. Has requirements.txt file for installing the required modules.
